<h1>About Photo Tools Web</h1>
<p>
Photo Tools Web is a personal project that allows for rough planning of photographs. The tool is best suited for landscape photography as the resolution of the satellite imagery in Google Maps is not detailed enough for smaller subjects like portraits or macro work. By selecting a camera type, focal length, aperture, and focus distance, the application calculates the depth of field, field of view, angle of view, and hyperfocal distance. This information is then visualized on the map to represent what the photograph would be. The angle of view is represented by the area within the lines (the angle), the marker represents the subject (at the given focus distance), and the shaded area represents the depth of field.

The equations used to calculate these numbers are available from many places online, including <a href="http://www.tangentsoft.net/fcalc/help/">http://www.tangentsoft.net/fcalc/help/</a> and <a href="http://www.dofmaster.com/equations.html">http://www.dofmaster.com/equations.html</a>. Sensor sizes and circle of confusion measurements are also available online at various locations including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_sensor_format#Table_of_sensor_sizes">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_sensor_format#Table_of_sensor_sizes</a> and <a href="http://www.dofmaster.com/dofjs.html">http://www.dofmaster.com/dofjs.html</a>. Many great thanks to the authors of these web sites as they served as an inspiration to put everything together!
